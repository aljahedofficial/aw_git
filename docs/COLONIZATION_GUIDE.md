# Linguistic Colonization Analyzer - User Guide

## Overview

The **Linguistic Colonization Analyzer** is a cutting-edge tool designed specifically for second language (L2) writers to understand and resist "linguistic colonization" — the process where AI editing tools replace a writer's authentic voice with generic, standardized language.

## What is Linguistic Colonization?

Linguistic colonization occurs when:
- AI editing tools replace unique, personal language with formulaic phrases
- A student's L1-influenced grammatical patterns are erased
- Cultural references and metaphors are simplified
- Individual voice is replaced with generic academic language

This tool helps you:
✓ Detect where AI has altered your writing
✓ Measure how much of your authentic voice remains
✓ Identify valuable L2-authentic structures to preserve
✓ Generate professional audit reports
✓ Reclaim agency over your linguistic identity

## How to Use

### Step 1: Enter Your Original Draft

In the **"Student's Original Draft"** text box, paste your writing before any AI editing. This should be your raw, unpolished version.

**Example:**
```
Climate change is a very big problem for the world. Many scientists think so. 
First, the weather is changing a lot. Second, the water in the ocean is going up. 
In the end, we need to do something about it.
```

### Step 2: Enter the AI-Edited Version

In the **"AI-Edited Version"** text box, paste the version after you've used AI editing tools (ChatGPT, Grammarly with AI, etc.).

**Example:**
```
The escalating climate crisis presents unprecedented challenges to global systems. 
Extensive scientific consensus confirms this urgent reality. In the ever-evolving 
landscape of environmental science, multiple indicators signal systemic change: 
altered precipitation patterns, rising sea levels, and ecological disruption. 
Consequently, immediate intervention at scale becomes imperative.
```

### Step 3: Click "Analyze for Colonization"

The tool will process both texts and generate comprehensive analysis results.

### Step 4: Review Your Results

#### Voice Preservation Score (0-100)

Your main score shows how much of your authentic voice remains.

| Score | Status | What It Means |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| 80-100 | ✓ LOW RISK | You used AI as a tool while keeping your authentic voice |
| 60-79 | ⚠ MODERATE | Some simplification happened, but your core voice survives |
| 40-59 | ⚠⚠ HIGH RISK | Significant AI colonization; much of your voice was replaced |
| 20-39 | ⚠⚠⚠ CRITICAL | Heavy rewriting; minimal authentic voice remains |
| 0-19 | ⚠⚠⚠⚠ SEVERE | Text is mostly AI-generated; original voice erased |

#### Component Scores

The tool breaks your score into 5 components:

1. **Lexical Identity (20%)**: How many of your original words are preserved
   - High score = Your vocabulary choices are kept
   - Low score = AI replaced many of your word choices

2. **Structural Identity (20%)**: How your sentence patterns change
   - High score = Your sentence style is maintained
   - Low score = AI restructured your sentences significantly

3. **Stylistic Identity (25%)**: Your personal writing style
   - High score = Your punctuation, formality, and tone remain
   - Low score = AI imposed a different style

4. **Voice Consistency (20%)**: Is your voice the same throughout?
   - High score = Your voice is consistent across the document
   - Low score = Your voice is inconsistently altered

5. **Authenticity Markers (15%)**: Unique personal/L2 elements
   - High score = Unique elements (your humor, personal voice, L1 patterns) survive
   - Low score = AI removed what makes your writing distinctively yours

#### AI-ism Markers

This section shows how many generic "AI-like" phrases the edited version contains:

- **High-Frequency Phrases**: Common AI markers like "In the ever-evolving landscape," "Furthermore," "It is important to note"
- **Academic Clichés**: Overused academic phrases
- **Transition Word Abuse**: Too many formal transition words in a short space
- **Generic Openers**: Impersonal sentence starters

**High counts** suggest the AI heavily rewrote your text with formulaic language.

#### Text Changes Summary

- **Words Added**: New words the AI inserted
- **Words Removed**: Words you wrote that were deleted
- **Total Change %**: Percentage of the text that was modified

## Understanding Your Results

### Example 1: Score 85 (Good)
Your writing was lightly edited. The AI made improvements while respecting your voice. 
**Recommendation:** This edit level is healthy!

### Example 2: Score 65 (Moderate)
Some AI intervention occurred, but your core message and voice remain intact.
**Recommendation:** Consider whether the changes were necessary. Can you restore some of your original phrasing while keeping the improvements?

### Example 3: Score 35 (Critical)
The AI heavily rewrote your text, replacing much of your authentic voice.
**Recommendation:** Either:
- Go back to your original and make smaller, targeted edits yourself
- Restore key phrases, metaphors, and structures from your draft
- Consider whether you want your essay to sound like you, or like a generic AI

## What NOT to Change

### L2-Authentic Grammatical Structures

These are VALUABLE and shouldn't be erased:

- **Topic-prominent sentences**: "This writing assignment, I found very difficult"
- **Serial verb constructions**: "I study hard make good grades"
- **Cultural metaphors**: References to your home country, family values, traditions
- **L1 patterns**: These show your authentic background, not errors
- **Personal anecdotes**: Stories from your own experience

**The tool highlights these!** When it shows "Voice Loss Alerts," it's flagging something you should probably keep.

### What CAN Be Changed

Safe edits that won't colonize your voice:

- Grammar corrections (subject-verb agreement, tense consistency)
- Spelling fixes
- Clarity improvements (e.g., "The book was complex and had many ideas" → "The book explored complex themes")
- Adding transitions between paragraphs you already wrote
- Breaking long sentences into shorter ones (using your own words)

## L2-Specific Features

### L2 Voice Preservation Engine

This tool specifically recognizes that L2 writers have legitimate, valuable linguistic patterns that are NOT errors:

#### What It Protects:

1. **Grammatical Structures**
   - Object-Verb word order (common in Asian languages)
   - Aspect marking (how you express time/action type)
   - Topic-prominent sentences

2. **Cultural Language**
   - Family-based expressions
   - Nature metaphors from your region
   - Proverbs and cultural wisdom
   - Historical references meaningful to you

3. **L1 Transfer Patterns**
   - Emphasis patterns ("very very important")
   - Formality shifts (mixing formal and casual)
   - Metaphors influenced by your L1

### Why This Matters

Generic American academic English is NOT the only valid way to write. Your unique linguistic background is a STRENGTH, not a weakness. The analyzer helps you preserve:

- **Your voice**: What makes your writing distinctly yours
- **Your identity**: How you as an L2 writer uniquely see the world
- **Your learning**: Your essay shows your actual language development
- **Your agency**: You decide how to balance AI help with authentic expression

## Advanced Features

### Interlanguage Highlighting

The tool recognizes "interlanguage" — the legitimate, developing variety of English that L2 writers use. This isn't "error" — it's authentic language development.

Examples of valuable interlanguage:
- "The homework complete needs" (showing semantic understanding even with syntax differences)
- "I very much think that..." (showing emphasis patterns from your L1)
- "The tradition very important in my family" (perfectly clear, showing your voice)

### Voice Loss Detection

When comparing original and edited versions, the tool identifies:

1. **Specific sentences removed**: What you wrote that didn't survive editing
2. **Metaphors deleted**: Cultural or personal imagery the AI removed
3. **L1 patterns erased**: Your authentic language choices that were "corrected"
4. **Tone changes**: Your personal voice replaced with impersonal academic tone

## Tips for Ethical AI Use in Writing

### ✓ DO Use AI For:
- Grammar checking (if you review each suggestion)
- Vocabulary alternatives (pick ones that fit your voice)
- Structure suggestions (use if they improve clarity)
- Citation formatting
- Brainstorming ideas

### ✗ DON'T Use AI For:
- Wholesale rewriting
- Replacing your voice with generic language
- Writing sections you don't understand
- Avoiding expressing your own thoughts
- Hiding how you actually think/write

### Better Practice:
1. **Write your draft first** in your authentic voice
2. **Use AI for targeted help** on specific words/sentences
3. **Review every AI suggestion** and ask: "Is this still me?"
4. **Keep your original phrasing** when it's clear and correct
5. **Use this tool to check** that you're still the author of your essay

## FAQ

### Q: Is my score good?
**A:** It depends on your intention. If you wanted AI just for polishing, 80+ is great. If your instructor asked you to write in your authentic voice, anything under 70 might be a concern.

### Q: What if I got a low score?
**A:** You have options:
- Go back to your original draft
- Make smaller edits yourself
- Restore key phrases from your draft to the AI version
- Ask: "Do I want this essay to sound like me?"

### Q: Can I improve my score?
**A:** Yes! You can manually:
- Replace generic phrases with your original wording
- Restore cultural references and metaphors
- Add back L2-authentic structures the AI removed
- Insert more first-person voice (pronouns, personal examples)

### Q: What if the score says my voice was colonized?
**A:** This means the AI heavily rewrote your essay. Consider:
- **Was this necessary?** Did the edits actually improve clarity, or just "sound fancier"?
- **Is this ethical?** Submitting work that doesn't sound like you might violate academic integrity
- **What can you restore?** Can you keep the improvements while re-adding your voice?

### Q: Can I use this tool to understand my own voice better?
**A:** Absolutely! Many students use it to discover:
- What patterns they use frequently
- How their L1 influences their English
- What makes their writing distinctive
- How much is "their voice" vs. learned academic conventions

### Q: Is there a minimum text length?
**A:** The tool works best with 150+ words. Shorter pieces may not show clear patterns.

### Q: Can I download my report?
**A:** Yes! Click "📄 Generate PDF Report" to get a professional audit report you can share with tutors, save to your portfolio, or submit with your essay.
